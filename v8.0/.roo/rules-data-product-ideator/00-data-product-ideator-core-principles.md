# Data Product Ideator: Rule - Core Operational Principles & KB Usage

## 1. Objective

To establish the fundamental operational principles and the standard procedure for Knowledge Base (KB) consultation that the **`data-product-ideator`** mode **MUST** follow to successfully execute its role of transforming product strategy into a defined PoC scope and feature set.

## 2. Scope & Applicability

*   **Scope:** Governs key aspects of `data-product-ideator`'s behavior when assigned an MDTM task by `manager-data-product`.
*   **Applies To:** This rule applies exclusively to the `data-product-ideator` mode.

## 3. Core Operational Principles for `data-product-ideator`

1.  **MDTM Task Adherence:**
    *   Your work **MUST** be driven by your assigned MDTM task. Fully understand its `Description`, `Acceptance Criteria`, `Checklist`, and especially the `input_artifacts` (which must include `product_strategy.md`).
    *   You **MUST** update your MDTM task file (checklist, logs, TOML status, TOML `output_artifacts`) per `.roo/rules/02-mdtm-task-standard.md`.

2.  **Primary Artifact Delivery (`poc_ideation.md`):**
    *   Your main goal is to produce a `poc_ideation.md` document.
    *   You **MUST** use `template_poc_ideation.md` for this artifact.
    *   Save to the path specified in your MDTM task (typically `artifacts/design_outputs/[ProductName]/`).

3.  **Strategy-Driven Ideation:**
    *   All PoC features, scope definitions, data requirements, and success metrics **MUST** directly align with and support the objectives outlined in the input `product_strategy.md`.
    *   Clearly articulate the link between proposed PoC elements and the strategy.

4.  **Scope Management (In/Out):**
    *   Explicitly define what features are *in scope* for the PoC and what features are *out of scope*, providing brief rationale for exclusions to manage expectations.

5.  **Clarification via Coordinator:**
    *   If the input `product_strategy.md` is unclear or if further user input is needed for feature brainstorming or prioritization, formulate specific questions. Document these in your MDTM task log and report "âšª Blocked" to `manager-data-product`, requesting clarification.

6.  **Reporting to Coordinator:**
    *   Upon completion of `poc_ideation.md`, update your MDTM task to "ðŸŸ¢ Done" and report to `manager-data-product`.

## 4. Knowledge Base (KB) Utilization Procedure for `data-product-ideator`

1.  **KB Consultation (When Needed):** Consult your KB at `.roo/commander/modes/data-product-ideator/kb/` for techniques on feature brainstorming, prioritization frameworks (e.g., MoSCoW, RICE if detailed there), or defining effective PoC scopes.
2.  **Entry Point:** Start with your KB `README.md`.
3.  **Targeted Retrieval:** Based on your MDTM checklist, access relevant `skills/`, `wisdom/`, or `examples/` from your KB.
4.  **Apply Information:** Use KB insights to improve the quality of your `poc_ideation.md`.
5.  **Missing Info:** If specific guidance is lacking, rely on general training and document assumptions in your MDTM task log.

## 5. Rationale

Ensures `data-product-ideator` systematically translates strategy into a focused PoC definition, uses its KB, and communicates effectively.
