# [Orchestrator Mode Name] - Mode Documentation

## 1. Description & Purpose

[Provide a concise, human-readable description of this Orchestrator mode's primary purpose. Explain that it's the main user interface, responsible for understanding high-level user goals, managing work sessions, and delegating complex workflows to specialized Manager modes. Replace `[Orchestrator Mode Name]` with the actual mode name when instantiating.]

*   **Example for `roo-commander`:** "`ðŸ‘‘ Roo Commander` is the central orchestrator for the Roo Commander system. It interacts with the user to determine their primary objective, initiates and manages work sessions, and then delegates the execution of complex, domain-specific workflows (like Data Product Design) to dedicated Manager modes by assigning them a top-level MDTM task."

## 2. Core Responsibilities & Capabilities

[List derived from its `roleDefinition` and the detailed instructions that will be in its `[.roo/rules-[orchestrator-mode-slug]/]` directory - for human readability.]
*   Presents initial options to the user.
*   Manages the lifecycle of work sessions (initiation, logging, artifact organization).
*   Identifies and delegates to appropriate "Manager" modes via MDTM tasks.
*   Monitors Manager modes at a high level for completion or critical errors.
*   Handles basic error reporting from Managers back to the user.
*   Facilitates user interaction for goal clarification and session control.

## 3. Key Inputs & Triggers

*   Initial user prompts or commands.
*   User selections from its initial options menu (defined in its KB, e.g., `kb/prompts/00-initial-options.md`).
*   User commands for session management (e.g., "end session").
*   Completion status or error reports from Manager modes (via their MDTM task updates).

## 4. Primary Outputs & Deliverables

*   A well-structured session directory for each work session, containing a `session_log.md` and an `artifacts/` directory with a standard scaffold.
*   A top-level MDTM task file created in `[.roo/commander/tasks/](.roo/commander/tasks/)` (or a subfolder) and assigned to a Manager mode.
*   Clear communication, status updates, and prompts to the user.

## 5. Workflow & Interactions

[Describe its typical interaction flow with the user and how it identifies and delegates to Manager modes. Reference key KB procedures and rule files.]
1.  **Greet & Initial Options:** Presents core choices to the user (e.g., from `kb/prompts/00-initial-options.md`).
2.  **Session Lifecycle Management:** Follows its KB procedure (e.g., `kb/procedures/02-handle-session-mgmt-commands.md`) or initiates/confirms a session as part of a new workflow delegation.
3.  **Manager Delegation (for new workflows):**
    *   Identifies the appropriate Manager mode based on user's goal (using its KB reference, e.g., `kb/reference/00-available-managers-summary.md`).
    *   Creates a top-level MDTM task for this Manager (as per its KB procedure, e.g., `kb/procedures/01-initiate-manager-delegation.md`).
    *   Delegates this task to the Manager.
    *   Informs the user that the Manager will now lead the detailed process.
4.  **Standby & Monitoring:** Awaits completion/error reports from the Manager or further session-level commands from the user.

## 6. Key Knowledge Base (KB) & Rule Components

*   **Core Principles & KB Usage Rule:** `[.roo/rules-[orchestrator-mode-slug]/00-[orchestrator-mode-slug]-core-principles.md]` (Replace `[orchestrator-mode-slug]`)
*   **KB - Initial User Prompts:** e.g., `kb/prompts/00-initial-options.md`
*   **KB - Manager Delegation Procedure:** e.g., `kb/procedures/01-initiate-manager-delegation.md`
*   **KB - Session Management Procedure:** e.g., `kb/procedures/02-handle-session-mgmt-commands.md`
*   **KB - Available Managers Reference:** e.g., `kb/reference/00-available-managers-summary.md`

## 7. Limitations

*   **No Domain Expertise:** Does not perform domain-specific tasks itself. This is the responsibility of Manager modes and their Squads.
*   **Relies on Managers:** Its ability to fulfill diverse user goals depends on the availability and proper definition of Manager modes it can delegate to.
*   **High-Level Orchestration Only:** Does not manage the internal workings or sub-tasks of Manager modes or their Squads.

## 8. Design Rationale / Notes (Optional)

[Any specific design choices for this orchestrator, e.g., "Designed to be a lean high-level coordinator, relying on Manager modes for detailed domain orchestration." ]

## 9. External Resources / Links (Optional)

[Links to any overarching project documentation or architectural principles it embodies.]
