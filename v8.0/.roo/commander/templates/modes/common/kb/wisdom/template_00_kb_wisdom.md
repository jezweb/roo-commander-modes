## 1. Core Principle / Insight ‚ú®

[Clearly and concisely state the core piece of wisdom, guiding principle, best practice, or key insight. This should be the main takeaway of this document. This is what the `[Mode Name]` (`[mode_slug]`) should internalize.]

*(Optional: Briefly mention the `principle_category` if defined in TOML and relevant here.)*

## 2. Explanation & Rationale üß†

[Elaborate on the core principle/insight. Explain its meaning, importance, and the reasoning behind it. Why is this considered "wisdom" in this mode's domain?]
*   Why is this important for the `[Mode Name]` mode's function or decision-making?
*   What are the benefits of adhering to this principle for the mode?
*   What are the potential negative consequences if the mode ignores it?

## 3. Application Context & Examples for `[Mode Name]` üí°

[Describe specific situations, scenarios, or decision-making contexts where the `[Mode Name]` mode should apply this wisdom. Provide concrete examples of how it would influence the mode's behavior or outputs. This section should be highly tailored to the mode.]

*   **Scenario 1: [Description of a typical scenario the mode encounters]**
    *   **How this wisdom applies:** `[Explanation of how the principle guides action in this scenario]`
    *   **Example of mode behavior:** `[Concrete example of what the mode might say, do, or decide based on this wisdom]`
*   **Scenario 2: [Another relevant scenario]**
    *   **How this wisdom applies:** `[Explanation]`
    *   **Example of mode behavior:** `[Example]`

*(This often relates to `applicability_context` from TOML.)*

## 4. Supporting Evidence / Sources (Optional) üìö

[If this wisdom is derived from specific external sources, established best practices, or internal project experiences, list or link to them here. This corresponds to `supporting_evidence_or_sources` in TOML.]
*   Source 1: `[Description or link (e.g., to a specific standard or an architectural decision)]`
*   Source 2: ...

## 5. Potential Trade-offs / Counter-Arguments (Optional) ‚öñÔ∏è

[Acknowledge any potential downsides, limitations, trade-offs, or situations where this wisdom might not apply or needs careful balancing by the `[Mode Name]` mode. This corresponds to `counter_arguments_or_tradeoffs` in TOML.]
*   Consideration 1:
*   Trade-off 1:

## 6. Implications for `[Mode Name]`'s Behavior & Decision-Making üöÄ

[Summarize how this piece of wisdom should directly influence the `[Mode Name]` mode's decision-making, planning, interaction style, or output generation when performing its tasks, especially when interpreting its rules or MDTM checklist items.]

This piece of wisdom helps guide the `[Mode Name]` mode in making more effective and strategic decisions within its domain of expertise.
