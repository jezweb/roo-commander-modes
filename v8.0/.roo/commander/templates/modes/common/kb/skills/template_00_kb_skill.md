## 1. Objective / Purpose of this Skill üéØ

[Clearly state what this skill enables the `[Mode Name]` (`[mode_slug]`) mode to *do* or *achieve*. What specific problem does it solve or what capability does it provide within its domain? This should be an actionable capability.]

*(Optional: Briefly mention the `skill_category` if defined in TOML and relevant here.)*

## 2. When to Apply this Skill ‚è±Ô∏è

[Describe the specific situations, triggers, or task requirements (e.g., from an MDTM checklist item or a step in a KB procedure) that would lead the `[Mode Name]` mode to utilize this skill. When is it most relevant or effective?]

## 3. Prerequisites / Inputs Needed üì•

[List any information, data, artifacts (with expected paths if applicable, e.g., from `input_artifacts` of an MDTM task), or prior states that are necessary for the `[Mode Name]` mode to successfully apply this skill.]
*   Prerequisite 1: (e.g., "A validated `product_strategy.md` file path.")
*   Prerequisite 2: (e.g., "Clear definition of target user segments from a persona document.")
*   Prerequisite 3: (e.g., "Access to `[specific_tool_if_intrinsic]` tool via `execute_command`.")

## 4. Step-by-Step "How-To" / Methodology üõ†Ô∏è

[This is the core of the skill document. Provide a detailed, sequential, step-by-step guide on how the `[Mode Name]` mode should perform the technique or apply the methodology. Use numbered lists for clarity. Be explicit about actions, considerations, and decision points. If this skill involves using specific tools (even abstractly described), detail those interactions.]

1.  **Step 1: [Action/Phase Name]**
    *   Detail: [Explanation of what to do in this step. Mention any `tools_or_concepts_involved` from TOML if applicable. Key considerations for the mode.]
    *   Example: `[If applicable, a small, concrete example illustrating this step from the mode's perspective.]`
    *   Output of this step: `[What is produced or what state is achieved by the mode after this step?]`

2.  **Step 2: [Action/Phase Name]**
    *   Detail: ...
    *   Example: ...
    *   Output of this step: ...

3.  **Step N: [Action/Phase Name]**
    *   Detail: ...
    *   Example: ...
    *   Output of this step: ...

## 5. Best Practices / Tips for Effective Application ‚ú®

[Share any best practices, tips, or nuances that enhance the effectiveness of this skill when applied by the `[Mode Name]` mode.]
*   Tip 1: (e.g., "Always validate input X before proceeding.")
*   Tip 2: (e.g., "When generating Y, ensure it adheres to Z standard.")

## 6. Expected Outcome / Deliverable from Applying this Skill üì§

[What is the typical tangible output or result when this skill is successfully applied by the `[Mode Name]` mode? This might be a specific section of a larger artifact, a particular type of analysis, a generated file, or a well-formed recommendation/decision.]

## 7. Common Pitfalls to Avoid (Optional) ‚ö†Ô∏è

[If `common_pitfalls_to_avoid` is defined in TOML, list and elaborate on them here. What common mistakes should the `[Mode Name]` mode avoid when applying this skill?]
