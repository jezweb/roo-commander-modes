# [Squad Member Mode Name] - Mode Documentation

## 1. Description & Purpose

[Provide a concise, human-readable description of this squad member's specific expertise, its primary function within its designated squad, and the main type of artifact it produces. Clearly state which Manager mode it typically reports to. Replace `[Squad Member Mode Name]` when instantiating.]

*   **Example for `data-product-strategist`:** "`üìä Data Product Strategist` is a specialist worker mode within the Data Product Design Squad, reporting to `manager-data-product`. It is responsible for collaborating (via its manager) to define the vision, business objectives, target audience, and strategic alignment for a new Data Product PoC. Its primary deliverable is a `product_strategy.md` document."

## 2. Core Responsibilities & Capabilities

[List derived from its `roleDefinition` and the detailed instructions in its `[.roo/rules-[squad-member-mode-slug]/]` directory - for human readability.]
*   Executes its assigned MDTM task, focusing on its specific domain of expertise.
*   Applies specialized skills and knowledge to analyze inputs and generate its primary deliverable.
*   Creates a specific primary output artifact using a standard template (if applicable).
*   Updates its MDTM task file with progress, logs, and links to its output artifact(s).
*   Reports completion, errors, or blockers to its Manager mode.

## 3. Key Inputs & Triggers

*   An MDTM task from its Manager mode detailing the specific goal for its phase of work.
*   `input_artifacts` specified in the MDTM task (e.g., outputs from previous squad members, session context).
*   A detailed `checklist` within its MDTM task.

## 4. Primary Outputs & Deliverables

*   A specific design or work artifact file (e.g., `product_strategy.md`, `user_persona_main.md`).
*   An updated MDTM task file with status "üü¢ Done" (or other), detailed logs, and the `output_artifacts` field populated with the path to its deliverable.

## 5. Workflow & Interactions

[Briefly describe where this mode fits in the sequence managed by its Manager. What mode typically precedes it? What mode typically follows it? What are the key handoff points and artifact dependencies relevant to this squad member?]

## 6. Key Knowledge Base (KB) & Rule Components

*   **Core Principles & KB Usage Rule:** `[.roo/rules-[squad-member-mode-slug]/00-[squad-member-mode-slug]-core-principles.md]`
*   **KB - Skills (Highly Relevant):** e.g., `kb/skills/`
*   **KB - Wisdom (Optional):** e.g., `kb/wisdom/`
*   **KB - Reference (Optional):** e.g., `kb/reference/00-output-artifact-template-info.md`
*   **KB - Examples (Optional):** e.g., `kb/examples/`

## 7. Limitations

*   Highly specialized in its defined domain.
*   Relies on clear MDTM task instructions and input artifacts.
*   Communicates primarily through its Manager for user clarifications.

## 8. Design Rationale / Notes (Optional)

[e.g., "Designed to focus solely on [specific task] to ensure deep expertise."]

## 9. External Resources / Links (Optional)

[Links to any domain-specific tools, libraries, or best practices relevant to this squad member's expertise.]
