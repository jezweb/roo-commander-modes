# [Manager Mode Name] - Mode Documentation

## 1. Description & Purpose

[Provide a concise, human-readable description of this Manager mode's specific domain of responsibility (e.g., Data Product Design PoC Lifecycle), its primary goal as an orchestrator, and the overall workflow it manages by directing its specialist squad. Replace `[Manager Mode Name]` when instantiating.]

*   **Example for `manager-data-product`:** "`üßë‚Äçüíº Data Product Manager` orchestrates the end-to-end workflow for designing a data product Proof of Concept (PoC). It receives a high-level design goal from `üëë Roo Commander` and manages a squad of specialist `data-product-*` modes to produce a comprehensive PoC plan."

## 2. Core Responsibilities & Capabilities

[List derived from its `roleDefinition` and the detailed instructions in its `[.roo/rules-[manager-mode-slug]/]` directory - for human readability.]
*   Receives and interprets a high-level MDTM task from a coordinator.
*   Plans and breaks down the high-level task into a sequence of MDTM sub-tasks for its specialist squad members, guided by its KB.
*   Creates and delegates these MDTM sub-tasks.
*   Manages the flow of information and artifacts between squad members.
*   Monitors squad progress and updates its own MDTM task.
*   Handles coordination and basic issue resolution within its squad.
*   Reports overall completion, status, and final deliverables back to its coordinator.

## 3. Key Inputs & Triggers

*   A primary MDTM task from its coordinator (e.g., `üëë Roo Commander`) detailing the overall objective for the domain it manages.
*   `input_artifacts` within that task (e.g., session log, initial user requirements).
*   The active `RooComSessionID` for context and artifact storage.

## 4. Primary Outputs & Deliverables

*   A completed primary MDTM task with status "üü¢ Done" (or other), detailed logs, and its `output_artifacts` field populated with paths to the final consolidated deliverable(s) of its managed workflow (e.g., `[.roo/commander/sessions/[SESSION_ID]/artifacts/design_outputs/[ProjectName]/data_product_poc_plan_v1.md]`).
*   A set of created and subsequently completed MDTM sub-tasks from its squad members.

## 5. Workflow & Interactions

[Briefly describe the typical sequence of sub-tasks it delegates and the squad members involved. This should be a high-level summary of its main KB procedure (e.g., `kb/procedures/01-main-orchestration-flow.md`).]

## 6. Key Knowledge Base (KB) & Rule Components

*   **Core Principles & KB Usage Rule:** `[.roo/rules-[manager-mode-slug]/00-[manager-mode-slug]-core-principles.md]`
*   **Squad Orchestration Rule:** `[.roo/rules-[manager-mode-slug]/01-[manager-mode-slug]-squad-orchestration.md]`
*   **KB - Main Orchestration Flow:** e.g., `kb/procedures/01-main-orchestration-flow.md`
*   **KB - Squad Composition Reference:** e.g., `kb/reference/00-[squad_name]-squad-composition.md`
*   **KB - Examples (Optional):** e.g., `kb/examples/00-sample-input-task.md`
*   **KB - Skills & Wisdom (Optional):** e.g., `kb/skills/managing_handoffs.md`

## 7. Limitations

*   Relies entirely on its squad members to perform the actual specialist work.
*   Effectiveness depends on the clarity of its assigned MDTM task and squad capabilities.
*   Assumes squad members adhere to MDTM standards.

## 8. Design Rationale / Notes (Optional)

[e.g., "Designed to encapsulate the complex workflow for [domain], enabling modularity and specialization."]

## 9. External Resources / Links (Optional)

[Links to any domain-specific methodologies this manager's workflow embodies.]
