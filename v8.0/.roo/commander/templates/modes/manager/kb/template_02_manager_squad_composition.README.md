# Documentation: Template `template_02_manager_squad_composition.md`

## 1. Purpose

This template defines the standard structure for a **Manager Mode's Squad Composition & Roles reference document**. This is a critical Knowledge Base (KB) file, typically named `00-[squad_name_lc]-squad-composition.md` (e.g., `00-data-product-squad-composition.md`) and located in a Manager mode's `kb/reference/` directory.

Its purpose is to provide the Manager mode with a definitive reference for:
*   The members of the specialist "squad" it orchestrates.
*   The specific role and primary responsibility of each squad member within the managed workflow.
*   The typical sequence in which squad members are engaged.
*   The key input artifacts each squad member expects and the key output artifacts they produce (including target locations and templates used).

This document is essential for the Manager mode to correctly plan and delegate MDTM sub-tasks as part of its main orchestration flow (defined in its `kb/procedures/01-main-orchestration-flow.md` or similar).

## 2. Usage

1.  **Copy Template:** When defining the squad for a new Manager mode by an agent like `meta-kb-editor` or a human developer:
    *   Copy `[.roo/commander/templates/modes/manager/kb/template_02_manager_squad_composition.md](.roo/commander/templates/modes/manager/kb/template_02_manager_squad_composition.md)` to the Manager's `kb/reference/` directory.
2.  **Rename File:** Rename it appropriately, e.g., `00-data-product-squad-composition.md` for `manager-data-product`.
3.  **Populate TOML Frontmatter (of the instance file):**
    *   Replace all placeholders (e.g., `[manager_slug_uppercase]`, `[Manager Mode Name]`, `[manager_slug]`, `[Squad Name]`, `[squad_name_tag]`, `[Primary Workflow Name]`) with values specific to THIS Manager mode and its squad.
    *   The `id` should be unique (e.g., `KB-REF-MDP-SQUAD-COMP-V1`).
    *   `target_audience` **MUST** be the Manager's slug.
    *   `created_date` and `last_updated` should be set to the current date/timestamp by the creating agent.
    *   Ensure `related_context` links to the Manager's `.mode.md` and its main orchestration flow KB procedure. Optionally add links to each squad member's `.mode.md`.
4.  **Customize Markdown Body (of the instance file):**
    *   Replace all bracketed placeholders like `[Manager Mode Name]`, `[manager_slug]`, `[Squad Name]`, `[Primary Workflow Name / Overall Squad Goal]`, `[squad_member_1_slug]`, `[ProductNameOrIdentifier]`, `[ActiveSessionPath]`, `[output_subdir]`.
    *   **Crucially, Section 3 ("Squad Members & Workflow Sequence") MUST be detailed extensively.** List each squad member in operational order, specifying their role, mode slug, responsibility for that phase, typical inputs, key outputs (including target filenames, `.roo/` anchored paths, and paths to templates they use).
    *   The Mermaid diagram in Section 4 is optional but highly recommended for visualizing complex flows.
