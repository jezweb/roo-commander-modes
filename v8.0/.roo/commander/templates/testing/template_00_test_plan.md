# Test Plan: {{ title | default: "[Specify Name of Unit/Feature Being Tested]" }}

## 1. Introduction & Objective

*   **Target Unit/Feature:** `{{ target_unit_or_feature | default: "[Specify]" }}`
*   **Overall Test Objective:** `{{ overall_test_objective | default: "[State the primary goal of this testing effort]" }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To outline the strategy, scope, resources, and schedule for testing the `[Target Unit/Feature]`. This plan will guide the execution of test cases and the evaluation of results.

## 2. Scope of Testing

### 2.1. In Scope
[Detail the specific functionalities, modes, interactions, rules, and standards that WILL be tested as part of this plan. Be specific.]
*   *(Corresponds to `test_scope_in` in TOML)*
    *   Item 1
    *   Item 2

### 2.2. Out of Scope
[Clearly list any functionalities, aspects, or conditions that will NOT be tested in this cycle, and briefly state why if important.]
*   *(Corresponds to `test_scope_out` in TOML)*
    *   Item 1 - Reason:
    *   Item 2 - Reason:

## 3. Test Approach & Strategy

*   **Overall Approach:** `{{ test_approach_summary | default: "[Describe the general methodology, e.g., manual simulation, scenario-based testing]" }}`
*   **Test Levels (if applicable):**
    *   Unit Testing (of individual Squad Members): [Approach]
    *   Integration Testing (Manager-Squad, Squad-Squad handoffs): [Approach]
    *   System/Workflow Testing (End-to-end via Orchestrator): [Approach]
*   **Test Data Strategy:**
    *   [How will test data be sourced or created? Will simulated data from `data-product-simdata-designer` be used? Any specific characteristics needed for test data?]
*   **Test Environment:**
    *   [Describe the environment where testing will occur. Any specific setup required?]

## 4. Test Deliverables

*   Completed Test Case documents (instances of `template_00_test_case.md`).
*   A final Test Summary Report (using `template_00_test_summary_report.md`).
*   (If applicable) Logged defects or issues in a tracking system or as MDTM bug tasks.

## 5. Test Cases & Scenarios

[This section can either list high-level test scenarios that will be detailed in separate test case documents, or directly link to the individual test case documents.]

*   **Reference to Detailed Test Cases:**
    *   All detailed test cases are documented separately and linked here:
        *   `{{ linked_test_case_documents[0] | default: "[Path to Test Case Doc 1]" }}`
        *   `{{ linked_test_case_documents[1] | default: "[Path to Test Case Doc 2]" }}`
        *   ...
*   **(Alternatively, list high-level scenarios here):**
    *   Scenario 1: [e.g., Successful end-to-end Data Product PoC design flow for a simple product idea.]
    *   Scenario 2: [e.g., Handling of missing input artifact by a Squad Member.]
    *   Scenario 3: [e.g., Error escalation from Manager to Orchestrator.]

## 6. Schedule & Resources (Optional)

*   **Proposed Timeline:** [High-level timeline for test execution]
*   **Testers/Roles Involved:** `{{ test_lead | default: "[Test Lead]" }}`, [Other roles]
*   **Tools:** [Any specific tools to be used for testing or defect tracking]

## 7. Success Criteria for this Test Plan Execution

[How will the success of this *testing effort itself* be determined? This refers to the execution of the plan, not just pass/fail of individual tests.]
*   *(Corresponds to `success_criteria_for_plan` in TOML)*
    *   Criterion 1
    *   Criterion 2

## 8. Risks & Contingencies for Testing (Optional)

[Any risks associated with the testing process itself and how they might be mitigated.]

This Test Plan provides the framework for ensuring the `[Target Unit/Feature]` meets its quality objectives.
