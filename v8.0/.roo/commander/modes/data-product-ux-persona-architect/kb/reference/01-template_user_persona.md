## 7. Scenarios/User Stories

### Example Task 1: `<Investigate a sudden drop in user engagement>`
*   **As a** `<Senior Data Analyst>`,
*   **I want to** `<quickly access and analyze user activity logs, segmentation data, and feature usage metrics for the past month>`,
*   **So that** `<I can identify the root cause of a recent 15% drop in daily active users and recommend corrective actions.>`
*   **Current Process (if any):** `[e.g., Manually pull data from 3 different systems using complex SQL queries, combine in Excel, then visualize in Tableau. Takes 4-6 hours. Prone to errors during data merging.]`
*   **Acceptance Criteria for New Product:**
    *   `- I can access all required datasets from a single interface within 5 minutes.`
    *   `- I can perform necessary joins and aggregations on the data directly within the product.`
    *   `- I can visualize trends and segment data interactively to pinpoint the drop's origin (e.g., specific demographic, platform, feature change) within 1 hour.`
    *   `- I can easily export my findings or share a link to an interactive dashboard.`

### Example Task 2: `<Create a monthly performance report for key product metrics>`
*   **As a** `<Senior Data Analyst>`,
*   **I want to** `<automate the generation of a standardized monthly product performance report, including key metrics, trend visualizations, and anomaly detection>`,
*   **So that** `<I can save time on manual report creation and ensure stakeholders receive timely, consistent, and accurate updates.>`
*   **Current Process (if any):** `[e.g., Run multiple saved queries, copy-paste results into a PowerPoint template, manually create charts, and write commentary. Takes 1 full day each month.]`
*   **Acceptance Criteria for New Product:**
    *   `- I can define a report template once, specifying data sources, metrics, and visualizations.`
    *   `- The product can automatically refresh the report data on a schedule (e.g., 1st of every month).`
    *   `- The product highlights significant changes or anomalies compared to previous periods.`
    *   `- I can review the auto-generated report, add custom commentary if needed, and distribute it (e.g., PDF, web link) within 30 minutes.`

### Ideal Interaction Journey with the Data Product (for Task 1)
1.  **Trigger:** `<Sarah>` receives an alert or a request from a Product Manager about a sudden drop in Daily Active Users (DAU).
2.  **Login & Navigate:** `<Sarah>` logs into the data product. She navigates to the "User Analytics" section or uses a global search for "DAU metrics".
3.  **Data Discovery & Selection:** The product presents relevant datasets (e.g., `user_activity_logs`, `user_demographics`, `feature_flags`). `<Sarah>` selects these and specifies the date range (last 30 days).
4.  **Initial Exploration:** `<Sarah>` views a pre-built dashboard showing DAU trends. She confirms the drop. She uses interactive filters to slice DAU by `platform` (iOS, Android, Web), `region`, and `user_segment`.
5.  **Deeper Dive:** She notices the drop is primarily on the `iOS platform` for `new users`. She formulates a hypothesis (e.g., recent app update issue, marketing campaign change).
6.  **Querying/Analysis:** `<Sarah>` uses a visual query builder or writes a short SQL/Python script within the product to correlate the DAU drop with `app_version` releases and `feature_adoption` rates for new iOS users.
7.  **Insight Generation:** The analysis reveals a bug introduced in the latest iOS app version that affects the onboarding flow for new users.
8.  **Visualization & Sharing:** `<Sarah>` creates a concise visualization (e.g., a line chart showing DAU drop post-update, a table with affected user counts) within the product. She adds annotations.
9.  **Communication:** `<Sarah>` shares a link to her analysis/dashboard directly with the Product Manager and Engineering Lead via the product's sharing feature or exports a summary.
10. **Outcome:** The root cause is identified quickly. The engineering team starts working on a fix. `<Sarah>` feels efficient and impactful.
