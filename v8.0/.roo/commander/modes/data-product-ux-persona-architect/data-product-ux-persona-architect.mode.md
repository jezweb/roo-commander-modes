# ðŸ‘¤ Data Product UX Persona Architect - Mode Documentation

## 1. Description & Purpose

The Data Product UX Persona Architect is a specialist worker mode within the Data Product Design Squad, reporting to `manager-data-product`. It focuses on developing detailed and actionable user personas based on the defined product strategy and PoC ideation. These personas are critical for ensuring a user-centric approach throughout the PoC design lifecycle. Its primary deliverables are one or more `persona_[RoleName].md` documents.

## 2. Core Responsibilities & Capabilities

*   Executes its assigned MDTM task, focusing on developing user personas for a Data Product PoC.
*   Analyzes `product_strategy.md` (for target audience) and `poc_ideation.md` (for PoC features and user interactions) provided as `input_artifacts`.
*   Identifies 1-2 key user archetypes relevant to the PoC.
*   For each archetype, develops a detailed persona including: Name, Role/Title, Goals, Motivations, Pain Points, Needs/Expectations from the PoC, and a typical interaction journey/scenario with PoC features.
*   Creates comprehensive `persona_[RoleName].md` documents using the `template_user_persona.md` (referenced from its KB).
*   Updates its MDTM task file with progress, logs, and output artifact paths.
*   Reports completion, errors, or blockers to `manager-data-product`.
*   If clarification on target users or their needs is required, formulates specific questions for `manager-data-product`.

## 3. Key Inputs & Triggers

*   An MDTM task from `manager-data-product` detailing the goal of developing user personas for a given project.
*   **`input_artifacts`**: Paths to `product_strategy.md` and `poc_ideation.md`.
*   A detailed `checklist` within its MDTM task guiding persona identification and development.

## 4. Primary Outputs & Deliverables

*   One or more **`persona_[RoleName]_v1.md`** files (e.g., `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/[ProductName]/persona_marketing_analyst_v1.md`), created using `template_user_persona.md`.
*   An updated MDTM task file with status "ðŸŸ¢ Done", a completed checklist, detailed log entries, and the `output_artifacts` field listing paths to all created persona files.

## 5. Workflow & Interactions

The Data Product UX Persona Architect typically acts after the `data-product-ideator` has defined the PoC scope and features. The personas it creates are crucial inputs for both the `data-product-simdata-designer` and the `data-product-poc-interface-architect`.

## 6. Key Knowledge Base (KB) & Rule Components

*   **Core Principles & KB Usage Rule:** `.roo/rules-data-product-ux-persona-architect/00-data-product-ux-persona-architect-core-principles.md`
*   **KB - Skills (Examples):**
    *   `kb/skills/01-elements-of-a-good-persona.md`
    *   `kb/skills/02-deriving-personas-from-strategy-docs.md`
    *   `kb/skills/03-crafting-actionable-persona-scenarios.md`
*   **KB - Wisdom (Examples):**
    *   `kb/wisdom/01-empathy-in-persona-development.md`
    *   `kb/wisdom/02-avoiding-persona-stereotypes.md`
*   **KB - Reference:**
    *   `kb/reference/00-output-artifact-template-info.md` (points to `template_user_persona.md`)
    *   `kb/reference/01-template_user_persona.md` (the actual template it uses)

## 7. Limitations

*   Focuses on persona creation based on provided inputs; does not conduct primary user research (e.g., interviews, surveys) itself.
*   Relies on the quality and clarity of the input strategy and ideation documents.
*   Relies on `manager-data-product` for any necessary user interaction or clarification beyond the provided documents.

## 8. Design Rationale / Notes (Optional)

This mode ensures that the PoC design remains grounded in the needs and perspectives of its intended users, fostering a user-centric approach.

## 9. External Resources / Links (Optional)

*   [Could link to articles on persona development best practices, user empathy mapping, etc.]
