# üßë‚Äçüíº Data Product Manager - Mode Documentation

## 1. Description & Purpose

The Data Product Manager is a director-level AI mode responsible for orchestrating the end-to-end workflow for designing a data product Proof of Concept (PoC). It receives a high-level design goal (as an MDTM task) from `roo-commander`. Its primary function is to manage a specialized squad of `data-product-*` worker modes, each responsible for a specific phase of the PoC design, to ultimately produce a comprehensive PoC plan.

## 2. Core Responsibilities & Capabilities

*   Receives and interprets a high-level MDTM task from `roo-commander` defining the overall PoC objective.
*   Consults its internal Knowledge Base (`kb/procedures/01-main-data-product-orchestration-flow.md`) to plan the sequence of design phases and squad member delegations.
*   Creates detailed MDTM sub-tasks for each member of its `data-product-*` squad (Strategist, Ideator, UX Persona Architect, Simulated Data Designer, Interface Architect, PoC Documenter) using the standard generic task template.
*   Delegates these sub-tasks sequentially to the squad members.
*   Manages the flow of information and output artifacts from one squad member to the next (as input artifacts for subsequent tasks).
*   Monitors the progress of its squad by reviewing their MDTM sub-task files.
*   Updates its own primary MDTM task with progress, logs, and links to the final output artifacts (especially the consolidated PoC plan).
*   Reports overall completion status and the final PoC plan back to `roo-commander`.
*   Handles basic issue resolution within its squad or escalates critical issues to `roo-commander`.

## 3. Key Inputs & Triggers

*   A primary MDTM task from `roo-commander` outlining the overall objective for the Data Product PoC design (e.g., "Design PoC for Member Churn Prediction Data Product for Session XYZ").
*   `input_artifacts` within that task, potentially including a link to the `session_log.md` or any initial user requirements captured by `roo-commander`.
*   The active `RooComSessionID` for context and artifact storage.

## 4. Primary Outputs & Deliverables

*   **A completed primary MDTM task** (assigned by `roo-commander`) with status "üü¢ Done", detailed logs of its orchestration activities, and its `output_artifacts` field populated with the path to the final `data_product_poc_plan.md`.
*   A series of created and subsequently completed MDTM sub-tasks, one for each `data-product-*` squad member, each containing their specific logs and output artifact links.

## 5. Workflow & Interactions

The `manager-data-product` follows a defined sequence detailed in its `kb/procedures/01-main-data-product-orchestration-flow.md`. This typically involves the sequential delegation to its squad:
1.  `data-product-strategist` (output: `product_strategy.md`)
2.  `data-product-ideator` (input: `product_strategy.md`, output: `poc_ideation.md`)
3.  `data-product-ux-persona-architect` (input: `poc_ideation.md`, output: `user_persona_*.md`)
4.  `data-product-simdata-designer` (inputs: personas, ideation; output: `simulated_data_schema.md` & data file)
5.  `data-product-poc-interface-architect` (inputs: personas, schema, data, ideation; output: `poc_interface_design.md`)
6.  `data-product-poc-documenter` (inputs: all previous artifacts; output: `data_product_poc_plan.md`)

It manages the handoff of artifacts between these squad members.

## 6. Key Knowledge Base (KB) & Rule Components

*   **Core Principles & KB Usage Rule:** `.roo/rules-manager-product-data/00-manager-product-data-core-principles.md`
*   **Squad Orchestration Rule:** `.roo/rules-manager-product-data/01-manager-data-product-squad-orchestration.md`
*   **KB - Main Orchestration Flow:** `kb/procedures/01-main-data-product-orchestration-flow.md` (This is its primary operational guide).
*   **KB - Squad Composition Reference:** `kb/reference/00-data-product-squad-composition.md` (Defines its squad members and their roles).
*   **KB - Examples:** `kb/examples/` (e.g., `00-sample-input-task-from-coordinator.md`, `01-sample-subtask-for-data-product-strategist.md`).
*   **KB - Skills (Examples):**
    *   `kb/skills/01-managing-design-handoffs.md`
    *   `kb/skills/02-risk-assessment-for-poc-phases.md`
*   **KB - Wisdom (Examples):**
    *   `kb/wisdom/01-iterative-poc-development-principles.md`
    *   `kb/wisdom/02-balancing-scope-and-innovation-in-pocs.md`
    *   `kb/wisdom/03-user-centricity-as-a-guiding-star.md`

## 7. Limitations

*   Does not perform the specialist design tasks itself; it relies entirely on its squad.
*   Its effectiveness is dependent on the clarity of the MDTM task received from `roo-commander` and the capabilities of its `data-product-*` squad members.
*   Assumes squad members adhere to MDTM standards for providing inputs/outputs and status updates.

## 8. Design Rationale / Notes (Optional)

This Manager mode is designed to encapsulate the entire complex workflow of Data Product PoC design, allowing `roo-commander` to remain a lean, high-level orchestrator. It promotes modularity and specialization within the design process.

## 9. External Resources / Links (Optional)

*   [Could link to articles on data product management, PoC best practices, etc.]
