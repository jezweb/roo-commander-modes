# Example: MDTM Task for Manager Data Product (from Roo Commander)

## 1. Purpose of this Example

This document provides a concrete example of a typical high-level MDTM (Markdown-Driven Task Management) task that the **`manager-data-product`** mode would receive from **`roo-commander`**. This task initiates the end-to-end workflow for designing a Data Product Proof of Concept (PoC).

It illustrates:
*   The expected TOML frontmatter fields and their typical values for such a task.
*   The kind of high-level goal, description, and acceptance criteria provided by `roo-commander`.
*   How the active session context is referenced.

The `manager-data-product` mode will use this task as its primary input to begin its orchestration of the `data-product-*` squad.

# Task: Orchestrate: Design Data Product PoC for 'Customer Retention Analyzer'

## 1. Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **Goal:** Manage the end-to-end design lifecycle for a Proof of Concept (PoC) of a new data product tentatively named "Customer Retention Analyzer".
*   **Context:** This task is initiated by `roo-commander` as part of user session `SESSION-RetentionPoC-20250718-095500`. All work and generated artifacts should be associated with this session. An initial user brief might be available in the session artifacts (see `input_artifacts`).
*   **Scope:** Oversee all design phases from initial strategy definition through to the creation of a comprehensive PoC plan document. This involves coordinating the specialist `data-product-*` squad.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] All phases of the Data Product PoC design lifecycle (Strategy, Ideation, Personas, Data Simulation, Interface Design, Documentation) are successfully completed by the respective squad members.
*   - [ ] A final, consolidated `data_product_poc_plan_v1.md` for the "Customer Retention Analyzer" is produced and its path is listed in the `output_artifacts` of this task.
*   - [ ] All squad sub-tasks are marked as "üü¢ Done".
*   - [ ] This primary MDTM task is updated to "üü¢ Done".

## 3. Checklist / Sub-Tasks üìù
*(This checklist will be populated and managed by `manager-data-product` as it orchestrates its squad. It outlines the high-level phases it will manage.)*

*   - [ ] **Phase 0: Ingest & Plan:** Thoroughly review this task and its inputs. Consult KB (`procedures/01-main-data-product-orchestration-flow.md`) to plan squad sub-task sequence. Update this checklist with planned phases.
*   - [ ] **Phase 1: Strategy Definition:** Create and delegate MDTM sub-task to `data-product-strategist`. Monitor for completion and `product_strategy_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] **Phase 2: Ideation & Scoping:** Create and delegate MDTM sub-task to `data-product-ideator`. Monitor for completion and `poc_ideation_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] **Phase 3: UX Persona Development:** Create and delegate MDTM sub-task to `data-product-ux-persona-architect`. Monitor for completion and `persona_*.md` files.
*   - [ ] **Phase 4: Simulated Data Design:** Create and delegate MDTM sub-task to `data-product-simdata-designer`. Monitor for completion and `simulated_data_schema_v1.md` / `simulated_data_v1.csv`.
*   - [ ] **Phase 5: Conceptual Interface Design:** Create and delegate MDTM sub-task to `data-product-poc-interface-architect`. Monitor for completion and `poc_interface_design_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] **Phase 6: PoC Plan Consolidation:** Create and delegate MDTM sub-task to `data-product-poc-documenter`. Monitor for completion and final `data_product_poc_plan_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] **Phase 7: Finalize & Report:** Update this task's `output_artifacts` with the path to the final PoC plan. Set status to "üü¢ Done". Report completion to `roo-commander`.

## 4. Log Entries / Notes ü™µ
*(manager-data-product will append its orchestration log entries here.)*

*   `[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ] - manager-data-product: Task ingested from roo-commander. Session ID: SESSION-RetentionPoC-20250718-095500. Planning squad sub-tasks.`

## 3. How to Use This Example

*   **For `manager-data-product`:** This illustrates the structure and typical content of the primary MDTM task you will receive from `roo-commander`. Use it to understand the expected inputs and the overall goal you need to orchestrate.
*   **For `roo-commander` (and developers):** This serves as a reference for how `roo-commander` should structure the MDTM tasks it creates when delegating a full Data Product PoC design workflow to `manager-data-product`.
