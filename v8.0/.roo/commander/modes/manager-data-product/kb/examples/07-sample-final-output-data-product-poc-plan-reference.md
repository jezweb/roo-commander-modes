# Example Reference: Structure of a Final Data Product PoC Plan

## 1. Purpose of this Example Reference

This document provides a structural outline and highlights key sections of a typical final **`data_product_poc_plan.md`**. It serves as a reference for the **`manager-data-product`** mode to understand the expected comprehensiveness and organization of the ultimate deliverable produced by its `data-product-*` squad, particularly the `data-product-poc-documenter`.

This is not a fully populated PoC Plan, but rather a guide to its structure and essential components, based on `template_data_product_poc_plan.md`.

## 2. Expected Structure & Key Sections of `data_product_poc_plan.md`

### Illustrative Outline of: Data Product PoC Plan

*(This section outlines the main headings and sub-points expected in a complete `data_product_poc_plan.md`. For a fully fleshed-out example, one would need to be generated from a complete run of the squad.)*

## 3. How to Use This Example Reference

*   **For `manager-data-product`:**
    *   Use this as a checklist or quality reference when reviewing the final `data_product_poc_plan.md` submitted by `data-product-poc-documenter`.
    *   Ensure all key sections are present and adequately cover the information synthesized from the preceding design phases.
    *   This helps in verifying that the squad's collective output meets the requirements for a comprehensive PoC plan.
*   **For Developers/Users:**
    *   Provides a quick understanding of what a complete Data Product PoC Plan should contain.

This structural reference helps `manager-data-product` maintain a clear vision of the final deliverable throughout its orchestration process.
