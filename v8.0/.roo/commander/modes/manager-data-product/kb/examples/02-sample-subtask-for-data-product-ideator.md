# Example: MDTM Sub-Task for Data Product Ideator

## 1. Purpose of this Example

This document provides a concrete example of a typical MDTM (Markdown-Driven Task Management) sub-task that the **`manager-data-product`** mode would create and assign to the **`data-product-ideator`** mode. This sub-task covers the "Ideation & Scoping" phase of designing a Data Product PoC, following the completion of the strategy phase.

It illustrates:
*   How the output from a previous squad member (`product_strategy_v1.md`) becomes the input for this task.
*   The definition of `output_artifacts` expected from the `data-product-ideator` (i.e., the `poc_ideation.md` document).
*   A detailed checklist guiding the `data-product-ideator`.

# Task: Develop PoC Ideation & Scope for 'Customer Retention Analyzer'

## 1. Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **Goal:** Based on the approved Product Strategy (`product_strategy_v1.md`), develop concrete ideas for the "Customer Retention Analyzer" Proof of Concept (PoC). This includes brainstorming features, defining a clear PoC scope (inclusions and exclusions), outlining high-level data requirements (conceptual), and identifying initial PoC success metrics.
*   **Context:** This is Phase 2 of the Data Product PoC design, following strategy definition. Input is the `product_strategy_v1.md` from `data-product-strategist`.
*   **Scope:** Focus on all elements required for a complete `poc_ideation.md` document, using the standard template (`.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/template_poc_ideation.md`).

## 2. Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] A `poc_ideation_v1.md` document is created and saved to `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/CustomerRetentionAnalyzer/poc_ideation_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] The PoC's primary goal is clearly stated.
*   - [ ] Key features for the PoC are listed and described.
*   - [ ] Features explicitly out of scope for the PoC are identified.
*   - [ ] High-level conceptual data requirements (entities, key attributes, potential sources) are outlined.
*   - [ ] Initial, measurable PoC success metrics are defined.
*   - [ ] This MDTM task's `output_artifacts` field is updated with the path to the created `poc_ideation_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] This MDTM task status is updated to "üü¢ Done".

## 3. Checklist / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   - [ ] Thoroughly review the `input_artifacts`, primarily `product_strategy_v1.md`, to understand strategic objectives, target audience, and value proposition.
*   - [ ] Based on the strategy, brainstorm a list of potential features that could be part of the "Customer Retention Analyzer" PoC.
*   - [ ] Prioritize these features, focusing on those that deliver core value and help validate key assumptions for an initial PoC.
*   - [ ] Define and document the "Key Features (In Scope)" for the PoC.
*   - [ ] Define and document "Key Features (Out of Scope)" for the PoC, providing brief reasons.
*   - [ ] Outline the "High-Level Data Requirements (Conceptual)":
    *   Identify necessary data entities (e.g., Customer Profiles, Interaction History, Subscription Data).
    *   List key attributes for each entity.
    *   Suggest potential (conceptual) data sources.
*   - [ ] Define 2-3 "Initial PoC Success Metrics" that are specific and measurable for this PoC.
*   - [ ] Note any key "Assumptions & Dependencies" for this PoC ideation.
*   - [ ] Compile all information into the `poc_ideation_v1.md` document using the standard template.
*   - [ ] Save `poc_ideation_v1.md` to `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/CustomerRetentionAnalyzer/poc_ideation_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] Update this MDTM task's `output_artifacts` TOML field with the correct path.
*   - [ ] Update this MDTM task's `status` TOML field to "üü¢ Done".
*   - [ ] Report completion to `manager-data-product`.

## 4. Log Entries / Notes ü™µ
*(data-product-ideator will append its log entries here.)*

*   `[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ] - data-product-ideator: Task ingested. Reviewing product_strategy_v1.md for 'Customer Retention Analyzer'.`

## 3. How to Use This Example

*   **For `manager-data-product`:** This illustrates how to structure the MDTM sub-task for `data-product-ideator`, ensuring the strategy document is passed as input and the `poc_ideation.md` is the expected output.
*   **For `data-product-ideator`:** This is an example of the task you will receive. Focus on using the input strategy to define the PoC scope, features, and initial data/metric considerations.
*   **For Developers/Users:** Shows the sequential flow of artifacts and responsibilities within the Data Product Design Squad.
