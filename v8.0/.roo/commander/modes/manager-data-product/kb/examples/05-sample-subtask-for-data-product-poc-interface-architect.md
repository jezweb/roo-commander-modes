# Example: MDTM Sub-Task for Data Product PoC Interface Architect

## 1. Purpose of this Example

This document provides a concrete example of a typical MDTM (Markdown-Driven Task Management) sub-task that the **`manager-data-product`** mode would create and assign to the **`data-product-poc-interface-architect`** mode. This sub-task covers the "Conceptual Interface Design" phase of designing a Data Product PoC.

It illustrates:
*   How user personas, PoC scope (from ideation), and the simulated data schema serve as key inputs.
*   The expectation of a `poc_interface_design.md` document as the primary output.
*   A detailed checklist guiding the `data-product-poc-interface-architect`.

# Task: Design Conceptual PoC Interface for 'Customer Retention Analyzer'

## 1. Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **Goal:** Based on the User Personas, PoC Ideation (features/scope), and Simulated Data Schema, design a conceptual user interface (UI/UX) for the "Customer Retention Analyzer" PoC. This should focus on how users will interact with the data to achieve the PoC's objectives.
*   **Context:** This is Phase 5 of the Data Product PoC design. Inputs include `persona_*.md`, `poc_ideation_v1.md`, and `simulated_data_schema_v1.md` (and sample data).
*   **Scope:** Produce a `poc_interface_design_v1.md` document using the standard template. This should include textual descriptions of UI components, key screens/views (e.g., a main dashboard), choices of visualizations, and high-level user interaction flows. Simple wireframes (Markdown tables, ASCII art, or descriptions of externally sketched wireframes) are encouraged. Focus on concept and usability, not high-fidelity visual design.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] A `poc_interface_design_v1.md` document is created and saved to `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/CustomerRetentionAnalyzer/poc_interface_design_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] The document outlines key UI components (e.g., dashboards, charts, tables, filters).
*   - [ ] Appropriate visualization types are chosen for the simulated data, aligning with PoC goals and persona needs.
*   - [ ] High-level user interaction flows for key PoC features are described.
*   - [ ] The design considers the goals and pain points of the target personas.
*   - [ ] This MDTM task's `output_artifacts` field is updated with the path to the created `poc_interface_design_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] This MDTM task status is updated to "üü¢ Done".

## 3. Checklist / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   - [ ] Review all `input_artifacts`: `poc_ideation_v1.md` (for features & scope), `persona_*.md` files (for user goals, needs, pain points), and `simulated_data_schema_v1.md` / `simulated_data_v1.csv` (to understand data to be presented).
*   - [ ] For each primary persona, identify 1-2 key user stories or scenarios from `poc_ideation_v1.md` that the interface must support.
*   - [ ] Outline the main views or screens for the PoC interface (e.g., Main Dashboard, Detail View if applicable).
*   - [ ] For each view, sketch or describe the layout of key components:
    *   - [ ] Identify necessary data visualizations (charts, graphs) and select appropriate types based on data and insights to be conveyed.
    *   - [ ] Define any data tables needed, specifying key columns.
    *   - [ ] List interactive elements (filters, buttons, search functionality).
*   - [ ] Describe the high-level user interaction flow for completing the key user stories/scenarios.
*   - [ ] Briefly document design rationale, explaining how choices support persona needs and PoC goals.
*   - [ ] Note any specific usability considerations.
*   - [ ] Compile all information into the `poc_interface_design_v1.md` document using the standard template.
*   - [ ] Save `poc_interface_design_v1.md` to `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/CustomerRetentionAnalyzer/poc_interface_design_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] Update this MDTM task's `output_artifacts` TOML field with the correct path.
*   - [ ] Update this MDTM task's `status` TOML field to "üü¢ Done".
*   - [ ] Report completion to `manager-data-product`.

## 4. Log Entries / Notes ü™µ
*(data-product-poc-interface-architect will append its log entries here.)*

*   `[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ] - data-product-poc-interface-architect: Task ingested. Reviewing personas, ideation, and data schema for interface design.`

## 3. How to Use This Example

*   **For `manager-data-product`:** This illustrates how to structure the MDTM sub-task for `data-product-poc-interface-architect`, providing all necessary design inputs (personas, scope, data context).
*   **For `data-product-poc-interface-architect`:** This is an example of the task you will receive. Your focus is on translating user needs and data into an effective and intuitive conceptual interface design.
*   **For Developers/Users:** Shows how the UI/UX conceptualization builds upon the user understanding, feature definition, and data design phases.
