# Example: MDTM Sub-Task for Data Product Strategist

## 1. Purpose of this Example

This document provides a concrete example of a typical MDTM (Markdown-Driven Task Management) sub-task that the **`manager-data-product`** mode would create and assign to the **`data-product-strategist`** mode. This sub-task covers the "Strategy Definition" phase of designing a Data Product PoC.

It illustrates:
*   The structure of a sub-task, including `parent_task_id` linking it to the manager's primary task.
*   How `input_artifacts` (like initial briefs or session context) are passed down.
*   The definition of `output_artifacts` expected from the `data-product-strategist` (i.e., the `product_strategy.md` document).
*   A detailed checklist guiding the `data-product-strategist`.

# Task: Define Product Strategy for 'Customer Retention Analyzer' PoC

## 1. Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **Goal:** Define the comprehensive product strategy for the "Customer Retention Analyzer" Proof of Concept. This includes clarifying the vision, business objectives, target audience, core value proposition, and strategic alignment.
*   **Context:** This is the first phase in the Data Product PoC design lifecycle, managed by `manager-data-product` (Task ID: `TASK-MDP-20250718-100000`) within session `SESSION-RetentionPoC-20250718-095500`.
*   **Scope:** Focus on all elements required for a complete `product_strategy.md` document, using the standard template (`.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/template_product_strategy.md`).

## 2. Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] A `product_strategy_v1.md` document is created and saved to `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/CustomerRetentionAnalyzer/product_strategy_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] All sections of the `product_strategy.md` template are thoughtfully completed and internally consistent.
*   - [ ] Key strategic objectives are defined in SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) format.
*   - [ ] The target audience and value proposition are clearly articulated.
*   - [ ] This MDTM task's `output_artifacts` field is updated with the path to the created `product_strategy_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] This MDTM task status is updated to "üü¢ Done".

## 3. Checklist / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   - [ ] Review `input_artifacts` (session log, initial brief) to understand the high-level PoC goal for "Customer Retention Analyzer".
*   - [ ] If user interaction is required for clarification, formulate questions and request `manager-data-product` to facilitate communication with `roo-commander`/user.
*   - [ ] Draft the **Product Vision** and **Mission**.
*   - [ ] Identify and document the primary **Business Problem** this PoC aims to solve and the **Opportunity** it addresses.
*   - [ ] Define 2-3 **Strategic Objectives (SMART)** for the PoC.
*   - [ ] Define the **Primary Target Audience** and key **Stakeholders**.
*   - [ ] Articulate the **Core Value Proposition**.
*   - [ ] Document the **Strategic Alignment** with broader business goals (if known, or make plausible assumptions).
*   - [ ] Outline high-level **Success Metrics** for the PoC strategy.
*   - [ ] Note any key **Assumptions & Constraints**.
*   - [ ] Compile all information into the `product_strategy_v1.md` document using the standard template.
*   - [ ] Save `product_strategy_v1.md` to `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/CustomerRetentionAnalyzer/product_strategy_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] Update this MDTM task's `output_artifacts` TOML field with the correct path.
*   - [ ] Update this MDTM task's `status` TOML field to "üü¢ Done".
*   - [ ] Report completion to `manager-data-product`.

## 4. Log Entries / Notes ü™µ
*(data-product-strategist will append its log entries here.)*

*   `[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ] - data-product-strategist: Task ingested. Reviewing initial PoC goal for 'Customer Retention Analyzer'.`
```

## 3. How to Use This Example

*   **For `manager-data-product`:** This illustrates how to structure an MDTM sub-task when delegating the "Strategy Definition" phase to `data-product-strategist`. Pay attention to providing clear inputs, defining the expected output artifact path, and setting a detailed checklist.
*   **For `data-product-strategist`:** This is an example of the type of task you will receive. Focus on understanding the goal, inputs, and following the checklist to produce your `product_strategy.md` deliverable.
*   **For Developers/Users:** Shows the flow of work and information from a Manager to a Squad Member.
