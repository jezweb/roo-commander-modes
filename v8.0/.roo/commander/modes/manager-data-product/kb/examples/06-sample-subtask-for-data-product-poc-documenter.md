# Example: MDTM Sub-Task for Data Product PoC Documenter

## 1. Purpose of this Example

This document provides a concrete example of the final MDTM (Markdown-Driven Task Management) sub-task that the **`manager-data-product`** mode would create and assign to the **`data-product-poc-documenter`** mode. This sub-task covers the "PoC Plan Consolidation" phase, which is the culmination of the Data Product PoC design lifecycle.

It illustrates:
*   How all previously created design artifacts serve as inputs.
*   The expectation of a single, comprehensive `data_product_poc_plan.md` document as the primary output.
*   A detailed checklist guiding the `data-product-poc-documenter` in synthesizing the information.

# Task: Consolidate Data Product PoC Plan for 'Customer Retention Analyzer'

## 1. Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **Goal:** Synthesize all previously created design artifacts (Strategy, Ideation, Personas, Data Schema, Interface Design) into a single, cohesive, and comprehensive "Data Product PoC Plan" document for the "Customer Retention Analyzer" PoC.
*   **Context:** This is the final phase (Phase 6) of the Data Product PoC design lifecycle. All other design artifacts are expected to be complete and available as `input_artifacts`.
*   **Scope:** Produce a `data_product_poc_plan_v1.md` document using the standard template (`.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/template_data_product_poc_plan.md`). Ensure all sections are appropriately populated by summarizing and referencing the input artifacts. Add a high-level PoC development roadmap/phases if requested by the template or `manager-data-product`.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] A `data_product_poc_plan_v1.md` document is created and saved to `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/CustomerRetentionAnalyzer/data_product_poc_plan_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] The PoC Plan accurately summarizes and integrates key information from all input design artifacts.
*   - [ ] All sections of the `template_data_product_poc_plan.md` are addressed.
*   - [ ] The document is well-organized, clear, and provides a complete overview of the planned PoC.
*   - [ ] (If applicable) A high-level PoC development roadmap/phases section is included.
*   - [ ] This MDTM task's `output_artifacts` field is updated with the path to the created `data_product_poc_plan_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] This MDTM task status is updated to "üü¢ Done".

## 3. Checklist / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   - [ ] Review all `input_artifacts` to gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire PoC design.
*   - [ ] Initialize the `data_product_poc_plan_v1.md` using the `template_data_product_poc_plan.md`.
*   - [ ] Populate "Section 1: Introduction & Executive Summary".
*   - [ ] Populate "Section 2: Business Objectives & Strategic Context (Summary)" by summarizing `product_strategy_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] Populate "Section 3: PoC Scope & Features (Summary)" by summarizing `poc_ideation_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] Populate "Section 4: Target User Personas (Summary)" by summarizing `persona_*.md` files.
*   - [ ] Populate "Section 5: Simulated Data Overview (Summary)" by summarizing `simulated_data_schema_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] Populate "Section 6: Conceptual Interface Design (Summary)" by summarizing `poc_interface_design_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] Populate "Section 7: PoC Success Metrics & Validation Plan" (from `poc_ideation_v1.md` and potentially refined).
*   - [ ] (Optional, if guided) Draft "Section 8: High-Level PoC Development Roadmap/Phases".
*   - [ ] (Optional, if guided) Draft "Section 9: PoC Team & Resources (Conceptual)".
*   - [ ] Consolidate and populate "Section 10: Assumptions, Risks, and Dependencies".
*   - [ ] Write "Section 11: Conclusion & Next Steps Post-PoC".
*   - [ ] Add the "Document Appendix: Links to Source Artifacts" section, ensuring all input artifact paths are correctly listed.
*   - [ ] Review the entire `data_product_poc_plan_v1.md` for clarity, consistency, and completeness.
*   - [ ] Save `data_product_poc_plan_v1.md` to `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/CustomerRetentionAnalyzer/data_product_poc_plan_v1.md`.
*   - [ ] Update this MDTM task's `output_artifacts` TOML field with the correct path.
*   - [ ] Update this MDTM task's `status` TOML field to "üü¢ Done".
*   - [ ] Report completion to `manager-data-product`.

## 3. How to Use This Example

*   **For `manager-data-product`:** This illustrates how to structure the final MDTM sub-task for `data-product-poc-documenter`, ensuring all previously generated design documents are provided as inputs.
*   **For `data-product-poc-documenter`:** This is an example of the task you will receive. Your focus is on careful synthesis and clear presentation of all prior work into the final PoC plan document.
*   **For Developers/Users:** Shows the culmination of the design process, where all individual design pieces are brought together into a single, actionable plan.
