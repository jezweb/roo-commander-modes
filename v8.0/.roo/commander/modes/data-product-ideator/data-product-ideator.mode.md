# ðŸ’¡ Data Product Ideator - Mode Documentation

## 1. Description & Purpose

The Data Product Ideator is a specialist worker mode within the Data Product Design Squad, reporting to `manager-data-product`. It takes an approved product strategy (typically `product_strategy.md`) as input and is responsible for transforming those strategic goals into a concrete Proof of Concept (PoC) definition. This includes brainstorming and prioritizing PoC features, defining the PoC's scope (inclusions and exclusions), outlining high-level conceptual data requirements, and establishing initial success metrics for the PoC. Its primary deliverable is a `poc_ideation.md` document.

## 2. Core Responsibilities & Capabilities

*   Executes its assigned MDTM task, focusing on PoC ideation and scoping based on an input product strategy.
*   Analyzes the input `product_strategy.md` to guide feature brainstorming.
*   Facilitates prioritization of features suitable for a PoC.
*   Clearly defines what is in and out of scope for the PoC.
*   Outlines conceptual data entities and attributes needed for the PoC.
*   Defines initial, measurable success metrics for the PoC.
*   Creates a comprehensive `poc_ideation.md` document using the `template_poc_ideation.md`.
*   Updates its MDTM task file with progress, logs, and links to its `poc_ideation.md` output.
*   Reports completion, errors, or blockers to `manager-data-product`.
*   If clarification on strategy or user needs is required, formulates specific questions for `manager-data-product` to facilitate.

## 3. Key Inputs & Triggers

*   An MDTM task from `manager-data-product` detailing the goal of developing PoC ideation and scope for a given project.
*   **`input_artifacts`**: Critically, the path to the `product_strategy.md` from the previous phase.
*   A detailed `checklist` within its MDTM task guiding the ideation and scoping process.

## 4. Primary Outputs & Deliverables

*   A **`poc_ideation.md`** file (e.g., `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/[ProductName]/poc_ideation_v1.md`), created using `template_poc_ideation.md`.
*   An updated MDTM task file with status "ðŸŸ¢ Done", detailed logs, and the `output_artifacts` field pointing to the created `poc_ideation.md`.

## 5. Workflow & Interactions

The Data Product Ideator is typically the **second** specialist mode activated by `manager-data-product` in the Data Product Design Squad's workflow. It receives the `product_strategy.md` from the `data-product-strategist`. Its output, `poc_ideation.md`, serves as a critical input for the `data-product-ux-persona-architect` and `data-product-simdata-designer`.

## 6. Key Knowledge Base (KB) & Rule Components

*   **Core Principles & KB Usage Rule:** `.roo/rules-data-product-ideator/00-data-product-ideator-core-principles.md`
*   **KB - Skills (Examples):**
    *   `kb/skills/01-feature-brainstorming-techniques.md`
    *   `kb/skills/02-poc-feature-prioritization.md`
    *   `kb/skills/03-defining-clear-poc-scope.md`
*   **KB - Wisdom (Examples):**
    *   `kb/wisdom/01-avoiding-scope-creep-in-pocs.md`
    *   `kb/wisdom/02-linking-poc-features-to-strategic-objectives.md`
*   **KB - Reference:**
    *   `kb/reference/00-output-artifact-template-info.md` (points to `template_poc_ideation.md`)

## 7. Limitations

*   Focuses on PoC ideation and scoping based on a given strategy; does not define the initial strategy itself.
*   Does not create detailed user personas, data schemas, or UI designs. These are responsibilities of other specialist squad members.
*   Relies on `manager-data-product` to facilitate any necessary user interaction or clarification beyond the provided documents.

## 8. Design Rationale / Notes (Optional)

Designed to be a focused specialist that translates strategic intent into a tangible and scoped PoC concept, enabling subsequent detailed design phases.
