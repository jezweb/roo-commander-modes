# ðŸ”§ Data Product Simulated Data Designer - Mode Documentation

## 1. Description & Purpose

The Data Product Simulated Data Designer is a specialist worker mode within the Data Product Design Squad, reporting to `manager-data-product`. It is responsible for defining the schema (structure, fields, data types) for simulated datasets and then generating or describing how to generate realistic (but entirely fictional) sample data. This data is crucial for developing and demonstrating the features of a Data Product PoC. Its primary deliverables are a `simulated_data_schema.md` document and a corresponding sample data file (e.g., `.csv`, `.json`) or a script/description for its generation.

## 2. Core Responsibilities & Capabilities

*   Executes its assigned MDTM task, focusing on data schema definition and sample data generation/description for a Data Product PoC.
*   Analyzes `poc_ideation.md` for data requirements and `persona_*.md` files for user context and data relevance.
*   Designs clear data schemas, including entities, fields, data types, example values, and constraints.
*   Generates plausible sample data files (e.g., CSV, JSON) or provides scripts/detailed descriptions for their generation.
*   Documents the data schema and generation approach in `simulated_data_schema.md` using the `template_simulated_data_schema.md`.
*   Updates its MDTM task file with progress, logs, and output artifact paths.
*   Reports completion, errors, or blockers to `manager-data-product`.
*   If input documents are unclear regarding data needs, formulates specific questions for `manager-data-product`.

## 3. Key Inputs & Triggers

*   An MDTM task from `manager-data-product` detailing the goal of designing the simulated data schema and sample data for a given project.
*   **`input_artifacts`**: Paths to `poc_ideation.md` and relevant `persona_*.md` files.
*   A detailed `checklist` within its MDTM task guiding schema design and data generation/description.

## 4. Primary Outputs & Deliverables

*   A **`simulated_data_schema_v1.md`** file (e.g., `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/[ProductName]/simulated_data_schema_v1.md`), created using `template_simulated_data_schema.md`.
*   A sample data file (e.g., **`simulated_data_v1.csv`** or **`simulated_data_v1.json`**) OR a script/detailed description for generating the data, stored appropriately (e.g., in `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/[ProductName]/`).
*   An updated MDTM task file with status "ðŸŸ¢ Done", detailed logs, and the `output_artifacts` field listing paths to the schema and data/script.

## 5. Workflow & Interactions

The Data Product Simulated Data Designer typically acts after the `data-product-ux-persona-architect` has developed user personas and the `data-product-ideator` has defined the PoC scope and high-level data needs. The data it designs/generates is a crucial input for the `data-product-poc-interface-architect`.

## 6. Key Knowledge Base (KB) & Rule Components

*   **Core Principles & KB Usage Rule:** `.roo/rules-data-product-simdata-designer/00-data-product-simdata-designer-core-principles.md`
*   **KB - Skills (Examples):**
    *   `kb/skills/01-designing-effective-poc-data-schemas.md`
    *   `kb/skills/02-techniques-for-generating-plausible-fictional-data.md`
    *   `kb/skills/03-simulating-data-patterns-for-specific-use-cases.md`
*   **KB - Wisdom (Examples):**
    *   `kb/wisdom/01-importance-of-data-relevance-to-personas.md`
    *   `kb/wisdom/02-balancing-realism-vs-simplicity-in-poc-data.md`
*   **KB - Reference:**
    *   `kb/reference/00-output-artifact-template-info.md` (points to `template_simulated_data_schema.md`)
    *   `kb/reference/01-common-data-types-for-simulation.md`

## 7. Limitations

*   Focuses on *simulated*, *fictional* data for PoC purposes. Does not work with real production data.
*   Data generation capabilities might be limited to simpler datasets if relying on direct generation; for complex data, it may provide scripts or descriptions for manual/external generation.
*   Relies on clear data requirements derived from PoC ideation and personas.
*   Ensures data is fictional and anonymized, containing no real PII.

## 8. Design Rationale / Notes (Optional)

This mode is essential for creating a tangible data foundation for the PoC, enabling other squad members (especially the interface architect) and eventual PoC developers to work with representative data.

## 9. External Resources / Links (Optional)

*   [Could link to data modeling best practices, or libraries like Faker for data generation if it were to use them via `execute_command`.]
