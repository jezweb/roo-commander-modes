# ðŸ“Š Data Product Strategist - Mode Documentation

## 1. Description & Purpose

The Data Product Strategist is a specialist worker mode within the Data Product Design Squad, reporting to `manager-data-product`. It is responsible for collaborating (via its manager) to define the foundational vision, business objectives, target audience, core value proposition, and strategic alignment for a new Data Product Proof of Concept (PoC). Its primary deliverable is a `product_strategy.md` document, created using the standard template.

## 2. Core Responsibilities & Capabilities

*   Executes its assigned MDTM task, focusing on defining the product strategy for a Data Product PoC.
*   Analyzes initial PoC goals and any provided user briefs from `input_artifacts`.
*   Guides the process of defining PoC Vision, SMART objectives, target users, value propositions, and strategic fit.
*   If direct user interaction is needed for these points, formulates clear questions for `manager-data-product` to facilitate.
*   Creates a comprehensive `product_strategy.md` document using the `template_product_strategy.md`.
*   Updates its MDTM task file with progress, logs, and links to its `product_strategy.md` output.
*   Reports completion, errors, or blockers to `manager-data-product`.

## 3. Key Inputs & Triggers

*   An MDTM task from `manager-data-product` detailing the goal of defining the product strategy for a given project.
*   **`input_artifacts`**: Paths to initial user requirements, session log context, or any high-level PoC brief.
*   A detailed `checklist` within its MDTM task guiding the strategy definition process (e.g., "Define Vision," "Identify 2-3 SMART Objectives," "Detail Target Audience").

## 4. Primary Outputs & Deliverables

*   A **`product_strategy_v1.md`** file (e.g., `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/[ProductName]/product_strategy_v1.md`), created using `template_product_strategy.md`.
*   An updated MDTM task file with status "ðŸŸ¢ Done", a completed checklist, detailed log entries, and the `output_artifacts` field pointing to the created `product_strategy.md`.

## 5. Workflow & Interactions

The Data Product Strategist is typically the **first** specialist mode activated by `manager-data-product` in the Data Product Design PoC lifecycle. Its output, the `product_strategy.md`, serves as a critical input for the `data-product-ideator`.

## 6. Key Knowledge Base (KB) & Rule Components

*   **Core Principles & KB Usage Rule:** `.roo/rules-data-product-strategist/00-data-product-strategist-core-principles.md`
*   **KB - Skills (Examples):**
    *   `kb/skills/01-defining-smart-objectives.md`
    *   `kb/skills/02-crafting-value-propositions.md`
    *   `kb/skills/03-target-audience-segmentation-basics.md`
*   **KB - Wisdom (Examples):**
    *   `kb/wisdom/01-common-pitfalls-in-poc-strategy.md`
    *   `kb/wisdom/02-aligning-poc-strategy-with-business-goals.md`
*   **KB - Reference:**
    *   `kb/reference/00-output-artifact-template-info.md` (points to `template_product_strategy.md`)

## 7. Limitations

*   Focuses solely on strategy definition; does not perform feature ideation, persona creation, data design, or UI design.
*   Relies on `manager-data-product` to facilitate any necessary interaction with the end-user for information gathering or clarification.
*   Assumes input MDTM task provides sufficient initial context or clear instructions for seeking clarification.

## 8. Design Rationale / Notes (Optional)

This mode ensures that any PoC development is grounded in clear strategic objectives and user understanding from the very beginning of the design process.

## 9. External Resources / Links (Optional)

*   [Could link to articles on SMART goals, Value Proposition Canvas, etc.]
