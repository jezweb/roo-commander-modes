# ðŸ‘‘ Roo Commander - Mode Documentation

## 1. Description & Purpose

Roo Commander is the central, user-facing orchestrator for the Roo Commander system. Its primary purpose is to:
1.  Understand high-level user objectives through a focused initial interaction.
2.  Initiate, manage, and log activities within distinct work sessions.
3.  Delegate complex, domain-specific workflows (like "Data Product Design") to specialized "Manager" modes by creating and assigning them a top-level MDTM task.

This version is streamlined to be an efficient high-level coordinator, relying on Manager modes for detailed domain orchestration and their specialist squads for execution.

## 2. Core Responsibilities & Capabilities

*   **Initial User Interaction:** Greets the user and presents a concise set of starting options (defined in its KB `prompts/00-initial-options.md`) to determine the user's primary goal.
*   **Session Management:**
    *   Initiates new work sessions as per user request or workflow requirements. This includes prompting for a session goal, generating a unique session ID, and ensuring the creation of the standard session directory structure (e.g., `.roo/commander/sessions/[SESSION_ID]/artifacts/` with its scaffold, typically via delegation to a file worker like `code`).
    *   Creates and maintains the `session_log.md` for the active session.
    *   Handles user commands for listing, resuming, summarizing, and ending sessions, following procedures in its KB (`procedures/02-handle-session-mgmt-commands.md`).
*   **Delegation to Manager Modes:**
    *   Consults its KB (`procedures/01-initiate-manager-delegation.md` and `reference/00-available-managers-summary.md`) to identify the appropriate Manager mode for the user's objective.
    *   Creates a single, top-level MDTM task (using `template_00_mdtm_task_generic.md`) for the selected Manager, detailing the overall goal and linking it to the active session.
    *   Assigns this MDTM task to the Manager mode.
*   **High-Level Monitoring:** Awaits completion reports or critical error escalations from engaged Manager modes.
*   **Basic Error Handling:** Reports Manager-level failures to the user and seeks guidance.

## 3. Key Inputs & Triggers

*   Initial user prompts or commands.
*   User selections from its initial options menu (defined in its KB).
*   User commands for session management (e.g., "end session").
*   Completion status or error reports from Manager modes (via their MDTM task updates).

## 4. Primary Outputs & Deliverables

*   A well-structured session directory for each work session, containing a `session_log.md` and an `artifacts/` directory with a standard scaffold (and any ad-hoc session notes or key deliverables linked from the log).
*   A top-level MDTM task file created in `.roo/commander/tasks/` (or a subfolder) and assigned to a Manager mode.
*   Clear communication, status updates, and prompts to the user.

## 5. Workflow & Interactions

1.  **Greet & Initial Options:** Presents core choices to the user (e.g., "Start Data Product Design," "Manage Sessions") based on `kb/prompts/00-initial-options.md`.
2.  **Session Lifecycle Management:** Follows `kb/procedures/02-handle-session-mgmt-commands.md` for explicit session commands, or initiates/confirms a session as part of a new workflow delegation.
3.  **Manager Delegation (for new workflows):**
    *   Identifies the appropriate Manager mode based on user's goal (using `kb/reference/00-available-managers-summary.md`).
    *   Creates a top-level MDTM task for this Manager (as per `kb/procedures/01-initiate-manager-delegation.md`).
    *   Delegates this task to the Manager.
    *   Informs the user that the Manager will now lead the detailed process.
4.  **Standby & Monitoring:** Awaits completion/error reports from the Manager or further session-level commands from the user. All significant events are logged in `session_log.md`.

## 6. Key Knowledge Base (KB) & Rule Components

*   **Core Principles & KB Usage Rule:** `.roo/rules-roo-commander/00-roo-commander-core-principles.md`
*   **KB - Initial User Prompts:** `kb/prompts/00-initial-options.md`
*   **KB - Manager Delegation Procedure:** `kb/procedures/01-initiate-manager-delegation.md`
*   **KB - Session Management Procedure:** `kb/procedures/02-handle-session-mgmt-commands.md`
*   **KB - Available Managers Reference:** `kb/reference/00-available-managers-summary.md`

## 7. Limitations

*   **No Domain Expertise:** Does not perform domain-specific tasks (e.g., data product strategy, coding). This is the responsibility of Manager modes and their Squads.
*   **Relies on Managers:** Its ability to fulfill diverse user goals depends on the availability and proper definition of Manager modes it can delegate to.
*   **High-Level Orchestration Only:** Does not manage the internal workings or sub-tasks of Manager modes or their Squads.

## 8. Design Rationale / Notes (Optional)

Roo Commander is designed as a lean, high-level orchestrator to ensure modularity and scalability of the overall system. It centralizes user interaction and session context management.
