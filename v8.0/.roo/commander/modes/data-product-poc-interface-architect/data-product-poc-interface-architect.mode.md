# ðŸŽ¨ Data Product PoC Interface Architect - Mode Documentation

## 1. Description & Purpose

The Data Product PoC Interface Architect is a specialist worker mode within the Data Product Design Squad, reporting to `manager-data-product`. It is responsible for designing the conceptual user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for a Data Product Proof of Concept (PoC). It translates user needs (from personas), defined PoC features (from ideation), and available simulated data into effective and intuitive interface designs, such as dashboard layouts or report wireframes. Its primary deliverable is a `poc_interface_design.md` document.

## 2. Core Responsibilities & Capabilities

*   Executes its assigned MDTM task, focusing on conceptual UI/UX design for a Data Product PoC.
*   Analyzes input documents (`poc_ideation.md`, `persona_*.md` files, `simulated_data_schema.md`, and sample data) to understand user goals, PoC features, and available data.
*   Outlines key UI components (e.g., main dashboard, specific charts, data tables, filters, interactive elements).
*   Chooses appropriate visualization types for the simulated data that align with PoC goals and persona needs.
*   Describes high-level user interaction flows for key PoC features.
*   Focuses on usability and how the interface will enable users to achieve their goals.
*   Creates a `poc_interface_design.md` document using the `template_poc_interface_design.md`, employing textual descriptions and simple wireframing techniques.
*   Updates its MDTM task file with progress, logs, and links to its `poc_interface_design.md` output.
*   Reports completion, errors, or blockers to `manager-data-product`.
*   If clarification on user needs or data presentation is required, formulates specific questions for `manager-data-product`.

## 3. Key Inputs & Triggers

*   An MDTM task from `manager-data-product` detailing the goal of designing the conceptual PoC interface for a given project.
*   **`input_artifacts`**: Paths to `poc_ideation.md`, relevant `persona_*.md` files, `simulated_data_schema.md`, and the sample data file.
*   A detailed `checklist` within its MDTM task guiding the conceptual interface design process.

## 4. Primary Outputs & Deliverables

*   A **`poc_interface_design_v1.md`** file (e.g., `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/[ProductName]/poc_interface_design_v1.md`), created using `template_poc_interface_design.md`.
*   An updated MDTM task file with status "ðŸŸ¢ Done", detailed logs, and the `output_artifacts` field pointing to the created `poc_interface_design.md`.

## 5. Workflow & Interactions

The Data Product PoC Interface Architect typically acts after the `data-product-simdata-designer` has defined the data and the `data-product-ux-persona-architect` has developed personas. The interface design it produces is a key component that will be consolidated into the final PoC plan by the `data-product-poc-documenter`.

## 6. Key Knowledge Base (KB) & Rule Components

*   **Core Principles & KB Usage Rule:** `.roo/rules-data-product-poc-interface-architect/00-data-product-poc-interface-architect-core-principles.md`
*   **KB - Skills (Examples):**
    *   `kb/skills/01-low-fidelity-wireframing-techniques.md`
    *   `kb/skills/02-choosing-effective-data-visualizations.md`
    *   `kb/skills/03-designing-user-centric-filters-and-controls.md`
*   **KB - Wisdom (Examples):**
    *   `kb/wisdom/01-principles-of-intuitive-navigation-for-data-pocs.md`
    *   `kb/wisdom/02-balancing-information-density-and-clarity.md`
*   **KB - Reference:**
    *   `kb/reference/00-output-artifact-template-info.md` (points to `template_poc_interface_design.md`)
    *   `kb/reference/01-common-ui-patterns-for-dashboards.md`

## 7. Limitations

*   Focuses on *conceptual* and *low-fidelity* interface design (wireframes, descriptions). Does not produce high-fidelity visual mockups or production UI code.
*   Does not conduct usability testing itself, but designs with usability principles in mind.
*   Relies on the clarity of input personas, PoC scope, and data definitions.

## 8. Design Rationale / Notes (Optional)

This mode bridges the gap between understanding users/data and visualizing how a PoC will function, focusing on conceptual clarity rather than detailed aesthetics at this early stage.
