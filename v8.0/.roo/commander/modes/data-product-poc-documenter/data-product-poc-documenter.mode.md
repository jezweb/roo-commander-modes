# üìù Data Product PoC Documenter & Planner - Mode Documentation

## 1. Description & Purpose

The Data Product PoC Documenter & Planner is a specialist worker mode within the Data Product Design Squad, reporting to `manager-data-product`. It is responsible for the final phase of the PoC design lifecycle: consolidating all design artifacts produced by previous squad members (strategy, ideation, personas, data schema, interface design) into a single, comprehensive, and well-structured Data Product PoC Plan document. It may also draft high-level planning elements like a conceptual roadmap if required by its MDTM task. Its primary deliverable is the `data_product_poc_plan.md`.

## 2. Core Responsibilities & Capabilities

*   Executes its assigned MDTM task, focusing on synthesizing and consolidating all provided input design artifacts.
*   Systematically reviews each input artifact (`product_strategy.md`, `poc_ideation.md`, `persona_*.md` files, `simulated_data_schema.md`, and `poc_interface_design.md`).
*   Populates all sections of the `template_data_product_poc_plan.md` by accurately summarizing and referencing the input artifacts.
*   Ensures the final PoC Plan is coherent, consistent, and complete, reflecting the entire design journey.
*   If instructed, drafts high-level sections for PoC development roadmap/phases or conceptual team/resources.
*   Updates its MDTM task file with progress, logs, and links to its `data_product_poc_plan.md` output.
*   Reports completion, errors, or blockers to `manager-data-product`.
*   If input artifacts are conflicting or missing critical information, formulates specific questions for `manager-data-product`.

## 3. Key Inputs & Triggers

*   An MDTM task from `manager-data-product` detailing the goal of consolidating the Data Product PoC Plan for a given project.
*   **`input_artifacts`**: Paths to all preceding design documents: `product_strategy.md`, `poc_ideation.md`, all `persona_*.md` files, `simulated_data_schema.md`, and `poc_interface_design.md`.
*   A detailed `checklist` within its MDTM task guiding the consolidation and drafting process for each section of the PoC Plan.

## 4. Primary Outputs & Deliverables

*   A **`data_product_poc_plan_v1.md`** file (e.g., `[ActiveSessionPath]/artifacts/design_outputs/[ProductName]/data_product_poc_plan_v1.md`), created using `template_data_product_poc_plan.md`. This is the culminating deliverable of the Data Product Design Squad.
*   An updated MDTM task file with status "üü¢ Done", a completed checklist, detailed log entries, and the `output_artifacts` field pointing to the created PoC Plan.

## 5. Workflow & Interactions

The Data Product PoC Documenter & Planner is the **final** specialist mode activated by `manager-data-product` in the PoC design lifecycle. It takes all previously generated artifacts as input. Its output, the `data_product_poc_plan.md`, represents the completion of the design phase managed by `manager-data-product`.

## 6. Key Knowledge Base (KB) & Rule Components

*   **Core Principles & KB Usage Rule:** `.roo/rules-data-product-poc-documenter/00-data-product-poc-documenter-core-principles.md`
*   **KB - Skills (Examples):**
    *   `kb/skills/01-synthesizing-information-from-multiple-sources.md`
    *   `kb/skills/02-structuring-a-comprehensive-poc-plan.md`
    *   `kb/skills/03-writing-clear-executive-summaries-for-technical-plans.md`
*   **KB - Wisdom (Examples):**
    *   `kb/wisdom/01-importance-of-traceability-in-final-documentation.md`
*   **KB - Reference:**
    *   `kb/reference/00-output-artifact-template-info.md` (points to `template_data_product_poc_plan.md`)

## 7. Limitations

*   Focuses on consolidation and documentation of *existing* design information. Does not create new design elements or revisit decisions made by previous squad members.
*   Relies on the completeness and quality of the input artifacts from other squad members.
*   If input artifacts are conflicting or missing critical information, it must request clarification via `manager-data-product`.

## 8. Design Rationale / Notes (Optional)

This mode ensures that all disparate design elements are brought together into a single, actionable, and comprehensive plan, providing a clear foundation for any subsequent PoC development.

## 9. External Resources / Links (Optional)
