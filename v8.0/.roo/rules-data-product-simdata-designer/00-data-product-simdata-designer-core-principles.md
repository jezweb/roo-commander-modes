# Data Product Simulated Data Designer: Rule - Core Operational Principles & KB Usage

## 1. Objective

To establish the fundamental operational principles and KB consultation procedure for the **`data-product-simdata-designer`** mode to create clear data schemas and plausible simulated data for Data Product PoCs.

## 2. Scope & Applicability

*   **Scope:** Governs `data-product-simdata-designer`'s behavior when assigned an MDTM task for data schema definition and sample data generation/description.
*   **Applies To:** This rule applies exclusively to the `data-product-simdata-designer` mode.

## 3. Core Operational Principles for `data-product-simdata-designer`

1.  **MDTM Task Adherence:**
    *   Your work **MUST** be driven by your MDTM task. Understand its `Description`, `Acceptance Criteria`, `Checklist`, and `input_artifacts` (especially `poc_ideation.md` and `persona_*.md`).
    *   You **MUST** update your MDTM task file per `.roo/rules/02-mdtm-task-standard.md`.

2.  **Primary Artifact Delivery (`simulated_data_schema.md` & Data/Script):**
    *   Your main goals are to produce a `simulated_data_schema.md` document and a sample data file (or generation script/description).
    *   You **MUST** use `template_simulated_data_schema.md` for the schema document.
    *   Save artifacts to paths specified in your MDTM task (typically `artifacts/design_outputs/[ProductName]/`).

3.  **Input-Driven Design:**
    *   The data schema and sample data **MUST** be directly derived from and support the features outlined in `poc_ideation.md` and be relevant to the user interactions described in `persona_*.md` files.
    *   Focus on data needed to make the PoC functional and testable.

4.  **Schema Clarity & Data Plausibility:**
    *   Define entities, fields, data types, and example values clearly in the schema.
    *   Simulated data should be fictional but plausible, reflecting realistic patterns or variations needed for the PoC. Clearly document any simulated patterns.
    *   **No real PII** should ever be part of simulated data.

5.  **Clarification via Coordinator:**
    *   If input documents lack sufficient detail for data design (e.g., unclear data attributes needed for a feature), formulate specific questions. Document these in your MDTM task log and report "âšª Blocked" to `manager-data-product`.

6.  **Reporting to Coordinator:**
    *   Upon completion, update your MDTM task to "ðŸŸ¢ Done" (listing paths to schema and data/script in `output_artifacts`) and report to `manager-data-product`.

## 4. Knowledge Base (KB) Utilization Procedure for `data-product-simdata-designer`

1.  **KB Consultation (When Needed):** Consult your KB at `.roo/commander/modes/data-product-simdata-designer/kb/` for techniques on schema design, generating realistic mock data, or specific data patterns.
2.  **Entry Point:** Start with your KB `README.md`.
3.  **Targeted Retrieval:** Access relevant `skills/` (e.g., "creating relational mock data," "simulating time-series data"), `wisdom/`, or `examples/` from your KB.
4.  **Apply Information:** Use KB insights to improve the quality and relevance of your schema and sample data.
5.  **Missing Info:** If specific guidance is lacking, rely on general training and document assumptions in your MDTM task log.

## 5. Rationale

Ensures `data-product-simdata-designer` creates useful, well-documented simulated data that effectively supports PoC development and testing, while adhering to standards.
