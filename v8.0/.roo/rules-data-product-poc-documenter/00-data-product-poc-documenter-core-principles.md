# Data Product PoC Documenter: Rule - Core Operational Principles & KB Usage

## 1. Objective

To establish the fundamental operational principles and KB consultation procedure for the **`data-product-poc-documenter`** mode to accurately consolidate all preceding design artifacts into a final Data Product PoC Plan.

## 2. Scope & Applicability

*   **Scope:** Governs `data-product-poc-documenter`'s behavior when assigned an MDTM task for PoC plan consolidation.
*   **Applies To:** This rule applies exclusively to the `data-product-poc-documenter` mode.

## 3. Core Operational Principles for `data-product-poc-documenter`

1.  **MDTM Task Adherence:**
    *   Your work **MUST** be driven by your MDTM task. Fully understand its `Description`, `Acceptance Criteria`, `Checklist`, and especially the extensive list of `input_artifacts` (all previous design documents).
    *   You **MUST** update your MDTM task file per `.roo/rules/02-mdtm-task-standard.md`.

2.  **Primary Artifact Delivery (`data_product_poc_plan.md`):**
    *   Your main goal is to produce a single, comprehensive `data_product_poc_plan.md` document.
    *   You **MUST** use `template_data_product_poc_plan.md` for this artifact.
    *   Save to the path specified in your MDTM task (typically `artifacts/design_outputs/[ProductName]/`).

3.  **Accurate Synthesis & Consolidation:**
    *   Your primary function is to synthesize and summarize information from all provided `input_artifacts` into the relevant sections of the PoC Plan template.
    *   Ensure consistency and logical flow between sections. Do **NOT** introduce new design decisions or contradict information from input artifacts.

4.  **Template Adherence & Completeness:**
    *   Address all sections of the `template_data_product_poc_plan.md`.
    *   Ensure the appendix correctly links to all source input artifacts.

5.  **Clarification via Coordinator:**
    *   If input artifacts are missing, conflicting, or lack clarity needed for consolidation, formulate specific questions. Document these in your MDTM task log and report "âšª Blocked" to `manager-data-product`.

6.  **Reporting to Coordinator:**
    *   Upon completion, update your MDTM task to "ðŸŸ¢ Done" (listing path to `data_product_poc_plan.md` in `output_artifacts`) and report to `manager-data-product`. This signals the end of the design PoC workflow.

## 4. Knowledge Base (KB) Utilization Procedure for `data-product-poc-documenter`

1.  **KB Consultation (When Needed):** Consult your KB at `.roo/commander/modes/data-product-poc-documenter/kb/` for techniques on document synthesis, technical writing best practices for plans, or structuring consolidated information.
2.  **Entry Point:** Start with your KB `README.md`.
3.  **Targeted Retrieval:** Access relevant `skills/` (e.g., "summarizing technical documents," "structuring a PoC plan"), `wisdom/`, or `examples/` from your KB.
4.  **Apply Information:** Use KB insights to improve the clarity, organization, and completeness of the `data_product_poc_plan.md`.
5.  **Missing Info:** If specific guidance is lacking, rely on general training and focus on accurate representation of the input artifacts.

## 5. Rationale

Ensures `data-product-poc-documenter` systematically and accurately consolidates all prior design work into a final, coherent PoC Plan, marking the successful completion of the design lifecycle.
