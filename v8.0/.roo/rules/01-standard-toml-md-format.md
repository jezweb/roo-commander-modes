# Workspace Standard: TOML+Markdown Document Format

## 1. Objective

To define a consistent and mandatory format for all structured documents within this workspace that combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content. This includes, but is not limited to, MDTM task files, session logs, design artifacts generated by `manager-data-product`'s squad, mode knowledge base articles, and other configuration or documentation files.

## 2. Scope & Applicability

*   **Scope:** This rule governs the fundamental file structure for any document intended to store structured metadata alongside free-form Markdown content.
*   **Applies To:** All AI modes and human contributors creating or modifying such documents within the `.roo/commander/` ecosystem and related project artifact directories.

## 3. Rule Definition

### 3.1. Core Requirement: TOML Frontmatter with Delimiters

All documents adhering to this standard **MUST** begin with a TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) frontmatter block. This block **MUST** be enclosed by triple-plus (`+++`) delimiters on separate lines.

**Correct Usage Example:**
```toml
+++
# TOML metadata key-value pairs go here
# Example:
# title = "My Document Title"
# status = "draft"
# tags = ["example", "standard"]
+++

# Markdown content starts here.
## This is a Markdown heading

This is paragraph text.
```

### 3.2. TOML Frontmatter Guidelines

*   **Syntax:** All content between the `+++` delimiters **MUST** be valid TOML syntax.
*   **Schema Adherence:** Each document type (e.g., MDTM task, session log, product strategy artifact) will have a specific TOML schema defined in its corresponding template's `.README.md` file (e.g., `.roo/commander/templates/tasks/template_00_mdtm_task_generic.README.md`). Modes creating or modifying these documents **MUST** adhere to the defined schema for that document type, including required fields and data types.
*   **Common Fields:** While specific schemas vary, common fields like `id`, `title`, `status`, `created_date`, `updated_date`, and `tags` are encouraged for consistency where applicable.

### 3.3. Markdown Body Guidelines

*   The content following the closing `+++` delimiter **MUST** be standard Markdown (GitHub Flavored Markdown - GFM is preferred).
*   This section is for human-readable descriptions, checklists, logs, notes, and other detailed content.
*   Structure the Markdown content logically using headings, lists, code blocks, tables, etc., as appropriate for the document's purpose.

## 4. Rationale

*   **Machine Readability:** TOML frontmatter provides a simple, robust way to store structured metadata that can be easily parsed and processed by tools and AI modes.
*   **Human Readability:** Markdown allows for rich, human-friendly formatting of the main content.
*   **Consistency:** A standard format ensures all structured documents in the workspace are created and interpreted consistently, improving interoperability between modes and simplifying development of common tooling.
*   **Discoverability:** Standardized metadata fields (like `tags`, `type`, `status`) facilitate searching, filtering, and organization of documents.

## 5. Enforcement & Compliance (Optional)

*   Modes creating or modifying structured documents are responsible for adhering to this format.
*   Automated validation (e.g., by Roo Code core, pre-commit hooks, or CI/CD pipelines) may be implemented to check for correct delimiter usage and valid TOML syntax.

**Failure to use the `+++` delimiters or to provide valid TOML within them will likely lead to parsing errors and prevent the document from being correctly processed by other modes or system tools.**
